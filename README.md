# Sol Ring
Sol Ring is a discord bot designed for the purpose of assisting with all your Magic the Gathering question and query needs. Sol Ring allows for user's to interface with Scryfall's Magic the Gathering API to enable users to search up game rules, card info, and other flavorful info about Magic the Gathering.

# How it Works
The bot uses the Scryfall API to query the database for the desired card or rule. The Scryfall API is a RESTful API that allows for easy querying of the database. The API allows for the user to query the database for a specific card or rule by name, set, or even by a specific card's ID. The API also allows for the user to query the database for a specific card's image, which is what the bot uses to display the card's image in the Discord chat.

# Why
My friends and I commonly play Magic the Gathering over discord a lot, sharing screens to simulate in-person play since we cannot due to us living in different states. Often there are questions that come up because cards are often hard to see over a 360p webcam (shocker). So instead of repeatedly asking players what card they have or just used constantly, they can use Sol Ring to learn about and better visualize cards in play.
